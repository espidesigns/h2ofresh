WebSite Identity Wizard - Setup Transcript and Report
=====================================================

Identity setup for h2ofresh.com [virtual]
performed at Tue May 25 17:33:07 2004


This identity shares the same mappings as other identities using 
the URL prefix (nickname) "h2ofresh". Therefore no new directories or 
mappings have been created.

STEP 1: IDENTITY ASSIGNMENTS
----------------------------

Assigned virtual host name h2ofresh.com
Assigned URL Prefix h2ofresh to host name h2ofresh.com
Requests will be logged in the master access log.
Administrator's email address initially set to master: <tech@cybersite.com.sg>
Set anonymous account for NT native operation to wspro_anon

NOTES
=====

* The URL for h2ofresh.com's home page is http://h2ofresh.com/
  which has been mapped to directory E:\h2ofresh\htdocs\

* Empty access and publish control paths have been added if not already present.

* h2ofresh.com is an IP-less identity. It is not bound to a unique IP address.
  Therefore it will work only with browsers that send the server hostname
  with each request. Most current browsers support the Host: header.
  It will also not work with SSL, as the Host: header field is required to
  identify the target hostname, the target hostname is required to send
  the appropriate certificate to open the SSL connection, yet the Host:
  header cannot be read until the SSL connection is open. This "chicken and
  egg" problem is unsolvable until SSL itself is changed.
